# Welcome to minnowSpace 

We are small but mighty.  Like that movie Ants.  


## Need (N): The world/USA is in dire need of a fair, decentralized social media platform that redistributes wealth and empowers individuals, as current centralized platforms exacerbate economic disparities, social division, and mental health crises. Americans are increasingly disillusioned and fatigued by systems that concentrate wealth and power among the top 1%, leaving the majority feeling disenfranchised and unheard.

## Approach (A): Minnowspace leverages decentralized technology to create a platform where users generate, own, and share the value they contribute. It ensures equitable revenue distribution, fosters community-driven collaboration, and promotes transparent governance, prioritizing user well-being and empowerment.

## Benefit (B): Minnowspace reduces the societal cost of centralized platforms—such as economic inequality, exploitation of user data, and declining mental health—by directly addressing these issues. By giving power back to users, it fosters a healthier, more inclusive online environment while enabling individuals to earn from their contributions. This leads to a win-win scenario where personal and societal prosperity grows sustainably.

## Competition (C): Unlike traditional platforms like Facebook or Instagram that centralize profits and control, Minnowspace disrupts the status quo by aligning user incentives with platform growth. It outcompetes by prioritizing equity, privacy, and transparency, offering a solution that resonates with individuals tired of being exploited by corporate monopolies.


## About N=ABC 
My uncle wrote a book about Innovation.  He came up with a formula for how to bring a product to market and have it be something people need.  N=ABC 
It's math.  I'm assuming since you are reading a github readme you know math.  N = A * B * C  N=Need A=Approach B=Benefit/Cost and C=Competition  Sometimes one of these is big enough, like people NEED water.  That's a great product.  But people don't really NEED social media.  We could play badmitton instead, how do you make people NEED it?  Approach (its easily accesesible on your phone & PC, its available 24/7 whenever you want).  Benefit?  It connects you to friends and family.  Cost?  Here's the thing, we are all 'the product'.  I want to flip that around.  We are sold these services as being 'free' but right now everyone is flocking to RedNote.  I rest my case on that one.  and Competition?  Well they never had any.  Until now.  We NEED money to get by and so far social media hasn't provided any.   I want to decentralize the internet once and for all.
